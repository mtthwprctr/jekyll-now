Brief notes on spoof/designer plasmons.

### Surface plasmons in metals
* Metals support modes localised near the surface. These arise due to coupling of electromagnetic radiation with oscillation of electrons in the metal.
* The modes are localised since they are evanescently confined perpendicular to the surface.
* These modes can be used in waveguiding and subwavelength confinement but there is a trade-off between losses and confinement.

### Structured surfaces and bound modes
* At THz frequencies, metals cannot support localised modes.
* Any periodic structuring (e.g. grooves, holes) on a surface will result in bound modes analogous to surface plasmons in metals.

### Metamaterial description
* If the surface structuring is a lot smaller than the wavelength, then we can treat it as an effective medium.
* The effective medium has a effective dielectric function with a 'plasma' frequency determined by the geometry.
* The dispersion relation of the modes is determined by the geometry of the structuring.

### Summary
* Since the properties of the bound modes are controlled by geometry, this gives the ability to design spoof surface plasmon modes are almost any frequency.
